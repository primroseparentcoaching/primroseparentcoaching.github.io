                        I'm a proud mother of three accomplished young adults, and I would love to work together

                            I am a former elementary school and piano teacher with a diverse multilingual, multicultural, 
                            and multi-professional background. My previous experience spans software engineering, biology, 
                            music, culinary arts, and entrepreneurship.

                        <p>
                            As an educator and as a parent, I've had many parents approach me throughout the years seeking 
                            advice on parental topics, even years after I had taught their children. Topics have been diverse, 
                            including setting boundaries, social and emotional wellbeing, separation anxiety, building confidence, 
                            managing routines, fostering connections, focus and concentration, sibling rivalry, defiance, 
                            eating habits, evaluating a child's developmental and academic needs, and navigating the 
                            uncertainties of parenting college age kids.

                            I bring to my coaching work my expertise, professional background, and personal parental insight 
                            and experience, keeping in mind your goals and your child's developmental needs.

                            <strong>Coaching is a process.</strong> For most clients, 10 one-hour sessions are recommended 
                            as it allows for comprehensive exploration and in-depth understanding of your parental needs. 
                            This time frame also allows for gradual acquisition of new parenting strategies, and provides 
                            flexibility for adjustments as new challenges arise or priorities shift.

                        <h3>Is parent coaching the same as therapy?</h3>

                        <p>
                            <strong>No.</strong> Parent coaching focuses on helping parents set and achieve specific goals 
                            related to their family life, parenting skills, and personal growth. It is a collaborative process. 
                            You share information about your family dynamic and your preferred future, and I provide a listening ear, 
                            sharing my expertise and years of experience related to child development, education, and working with parents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therapy, on the other hand, is geared towards addressing emotional and psychological issues, 
                            including mental health concerns and past experiences.

                            This encompasses nurturing the relationships between grandparents and their children, as well as 
                            fostering strong bonds with their grandchildren.

                                That insight has value. Many times when I was stuck, in despair, she came up with creative ways 
                                for me to reconnect with my children. There were key moments in our discussions when she would say 
                                something, point out a different perspective, which became ah-hah paradigm shifting moments.

                                providing clarity and comfort in moments of uncertainty. I wholeheartedly recommend her to any parent

                                As a former elementary school and piano teacher, I've worked with hundreds of children 
                                and their families over the years. This experience, combined with raising my own three 
                                children, gives me unique insight into child development and family dynamics.
